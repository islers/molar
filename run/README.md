run
=====

If you compile the graphical user interface, the executable will be written to this folder. In the "generic classes" folder an "Unknown Type" class is already provided for convenience to allow the addition of new types. If you delete it you will have to provide an alternative default class, otherwise you won't be able to add new types to empty projects in the GUI.

If you run into problems and the GUI does not give sufficient information about the cause, try running the program from console to get additional information.
