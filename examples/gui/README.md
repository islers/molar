gui example
=====

The MOLAR GUI loads and saves configuration files, feature and classifier data relative to its position. Move your compiled MOLAR executable to this folder and start it, then load the "twoHelixTypes_example.swsc"-file using the GUI's "load"-button.<br /><br />

<i>Note: If you can't start the application after moving it, you probably need to remark it as "executable". One way of doing so is to type "chmod a+x molar" in the terminal.</i>
